                      <p>Vinoy Kumar Singh, a 1987 batch AP Cadre IPS officer is a legendary police officer. His professional integrity, social policing, boldness to call 'Spade a Spade' and sterling performance against the Naxalites and the criminal warlords in Andhra Pradesh and Bihar is simply unparalleled. He hails from Akhgaon village of Bhojpur District of Bihar and worked both in Andhra Pradesh and Bihar Police in different capacities.</p>
					  <p>At the behest of Bihar Police, he raised 'Special Task Force' in Bihar and achieved unexpected result against dreaded ganglords. He became a household name as a police officer and many editorials and TV reels were run on him. Aaj Tak, the Hindi news channel ran a 40 - minute documentary on him for his exploits in Bihar.</p>
					  <p>He introduced many innovative methods like people's council, social welfare and development cell, emergency card etc under the aegis of police that changed the rules of game and threatened the very existence of vested interests.</p>
					  <p>The concept of "Police as a social worker" was taken up so seriously that Government found him very inconvenient. He is a hardcore policeman and has foreseen scope and vast possibilities of socio - economic changes through police efforts. His passion is policing and mission ' changes in police '. His vision of policing is boundless, holistic, moral and all comprehensive. His philosophy is : Police can change the society but everywhere they are fettered, manoeuvered and misused through their own subculture, officers and men and powers-that-be. In nutshell, he is less a writer and more an explorer, experimenter, visionary and path-breaker.</p>
